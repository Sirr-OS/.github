# Sirr OS

**Sirr OS** is a privacy-first Linux distribution for mobile and embedded devices, developed and focused on digital freedom, user sovereignty, and system transparency.

Built on a mainline Linux stack and designed primarily for the **PinePhone Pro**, Sirr OS does not attempt to replicate mainstream mobile platforms. Instead, it offers a minimal, hackable environment that gives users full control over their hardware and software.

## Our Philosophy

We believe a personal device should:

* Respect user privacy by default
* Remain fully auditable and modifiable
* Avoid unnecessary tracking, telemetry, or vendor lock-in
* Empower users rather than extract data from them

Sirr OS is designed for people who value **ownership over convenience** and prefer intentional computing over always-online ecosystems.

## What We Build

Our work focuses on:

* Privacy-oriented system defaults
* Strong encryption and secure storage
* Anonymity and network-level privacy tooling
* Clean, minimal Linux environments for ARM devices
* Experimental and alternative mobile use cases

Sirr OS is not positioned as a mass-market smartphone OS, but as a flexible Linux platform that can be adapted for secure communication, development, self-hosting, and experimentation.

## Who It’s For

Sirr OS is aimed at:

* Privacy and security enthusiasts
* Developers and Linux tinkerers
* Journalists, activists, and researchers
* Users seeking a distraction-free or purpose-driven device

## Open Source & Community

Sirr OS is developed in the open and guided by community values.
We welcome contributors who share an interest in privacy, Linux on mobile hardware, and alternative approaches to personal computing.
